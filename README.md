# Personal Portfolio

This repository contains the source code for my personal portfolio website.

The site is designed to showcase my background, projects, and interests in software engineering and data science, and serves as a central place to view my work and contact details.

This portfolio is actively evolving as I continue learning and building projects.

## Live Site
https://kazan-villanueva.com

## Tech Stack
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- GitHub REST API

## Features
- Clean, responsive layout
- Projects page that automatically fetches repositories from GitHub
- Dedicated sections for About, Projects, CV, and Climbing
- Subtle animated background for visual polish

## Projects Integration
The Projects page uses the GitHub API to dynamically load my public repositories, displaying:

This ensures the portfolio stays up to date as I continue building new projects.

## Development
Built using **Visual Studio Code** and deployed via **GitHub Pages**.
