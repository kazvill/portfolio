        <p>
          I’m a postgraduate student studying MSc Data Science at UWE Bristol, with a BSc (2:1) in Cyber Security and Digital Forensics.
        </p>

        <p>
          I have experience working with <strong>Python, SQL, HTML, and C/C++</strong>, and I’m continuing to develop my understanding of software engineering 
          through coursework and personal projects. I’m particularly interested in learning how real-world systems are built, maintained, and improved over time.
        </p>

        <p>
          Outside of technology, climbing is my main hobby. I currently climb around V5–V6 and both boulder and rope climb. 
          The problem-solving, strength, and discipline required help me stay balanced and focused, especially during demanding academic work.
        </p>  

        <p>
          I’m also learning <strong>Spanish</strong> and <strong>Mandarin</strong> for fluency and personal interest. Language learning requires long-term commitment and 
          steady progress, which closely reflects how I approach both climbing and technical subjects.
